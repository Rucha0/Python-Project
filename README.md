“Menu driven Beauty care products with Tkinter”

Shopping online is much better than going into stalls and shops to buy goods and ask for services to be rendered because it saves a lot of time. One can easily browse through different online shops and e-commerce stores to select whatever they want within the shortest possible time.
In one of the survey, it is revealed that most of the women purchase and use beauty products for psychological reasons like self-esteem and boosting their attractiveness to men.
Nowadays people are more dependent on online things as it is very convenient, time saving as well as it is pocket friendly.
So, my project is about the beauty products that we need on daily basis. 
People are now more concern about their hair and skin as they have to go out frequently and they have to face pollution, dirt etc.
So, I thought why not I should make something that will help them to buy the things easily and at very reasonable rate.
I have made my project with the help of Tkinter.
